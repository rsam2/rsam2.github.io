      I am a second year mechanical engineering student passionate about clean
      energy and being able to harness it to enable a liveable future. I have
      taken a liking to CAD and Python would like to apply my current knowledge
      to solve real-world problems.

      Outside of school, you can find me in my school's solar car shop
      fabricating the car's main components, baking something sweet in my
      kitchen, or spending time with friends and family.

    <h3 id="home-desc">
      This website is a collection of projects that I've worked on in and out of
      school and a few other bits and pieces that make me who I am. I hope you
      enjoy!
